    Binning, also known as bucketing, is a data preprocessing technique used to reduce the effects of minor observation errors.
    grouping a set of numerical values into bins or intervals.
    smoothing data and in handling noisy data by creating a more manageable number of categories.
    commonly used in histogram representation for continuous data.
    can be performed in different ways: equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning, and custom binning.
    equal-width binning: divides the range of data into intervals of equal size.
    equal-frequency binning: divides the data into intervals that contain approximately the same number of samples.
    binning can lead to loss of information, especially if the number of bins is not chosen carefully.
